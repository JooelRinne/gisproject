# GIS project - Modifying and analyzing Flickr data for wildlife conservation

- The "densitycode.ipynb" file contains Python code which can be used to calculate Flickr post densities in national parks and join preprocessed accessibility data. The results are summarized on park, national and regional levels. 

The results can be found in the "Park density and accessibility tables" folder.

- The "correlation_plotting.ipynb" Python notebook shows how the scatter plots for studying park accessibility and post density were created.

- "Language_analysis.ipynb" notebook walks through the step to recreate the linguistic analysis aspect of the project.

- In "Point pattern analysis" R script, a library called Spatstat was utilized to study how the photos are dispersed in Sub-Saharan national parks.

- QGIS project with the kernel density raster layer of Sub-Saharan national parks can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iliC6jgAf3X6h7CcfY8O0rB7QWpz2QL2/view
